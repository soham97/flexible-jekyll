Siemens MakeItReal hackathon conducted by hackerearth was an amazing experience for me. The hackathon challenged participants to develop a prototype under themes of mobility, healthcare, building technologies, digital factories, energy management. It consisted of two phases online and then an offline prototype building round at Bangalore. You can check it out further at [competition](https://www.hackerearth.com/sprints/makeitreal/).

Just a bit of digression on the motivation of selecting predictive maintenance under digital factory as our theme. 

Being a Siemens intern who had just dipped his feet in machine learning, I could first hand experience the problem of machine downtime and what it was costing Siemens. With appropriate sensor network, calculating the breakdown time of machine seemed plausible to me (didn't know at that time it was called RUL). The ROI on the idea was also large, and would help every manufacturing plant. Having big goals in mind, the only thing left was just making the idea work ;)
