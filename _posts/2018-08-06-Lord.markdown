## Problem statement:
Email Marketing is still the most successful marketing channel and the essential element of any digital marketing strategy. Marketers spend a lot of time in writing that perfect email, labouring over each word, catchy layouts on multiple devices to get them best in-industry open rates & click rates. 'How can I build my campaign to increase the click-through rates of email?' - a question that is often heard when marketers are creating their email marketing plans. Can we optimize our email marketing campaigns with Data Science? <br>
It's time to unlock marketing potential and build some exceptional data-science products for email marketing. <br>

## Under-sampling using Repeated Edited Nearest Neighbour Algorithm

The train dataset was highly imbalanced and contained 1010409 samples with is_click=0 while only 12782 samples with is_click=1.

<p align="center">
<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/lord/output.png" alt="Output Distribution"/>
</p>

After undersampling the data using RENN, the number of samples with is_click=0 was reduced to 958301. Other algorithms such as ENN, AllKNN and SMOTE were also explored. But I found RENN to the best of all though it required significant amount of time to undersample the dataset.

## Our Solution

The overall solution consists of a weighted average ensemble of two boosting algorithms -
- XGBoost
- LightGBM


---

## Results

| Sr No. | Public LB AUC | Private LB AUC |
|:----:|:----:|:------:|
| LightGBM | 0.68173 | - |
| XGBoost | 0.66823 | - |
| Ensemble | 0.68799 | 0.68630 |

#### Key Points - 

- LightGBM outperformed XGBoost by a significant margin. Moreover, it required much less time to train than XGBoost. 
- Extracting prominent features provided a major boost to the score. Most of these features were based on modelling user characteristics and extracting time series properties.
- Undersampling the data also provided a significant increase in the score.
- Boosting algorithms mostly ruled the competition.
